# The artifact contract

*The directory a build leaves behind, and which every later stage reads. It is the seam
between compiling a package and publishing one, and it is the reason those two jobs can
live in different tools without either importing the other.*

Owned by owfeed, because owfeed has more than one consumer of it. Producers are free —
`owlab build`, `owfeed build`, `openwrt/gh-action-sdk`, or a hand-written SDK invocation
all satisfy it the same way.

## Shape

```
dist/
├── x86_64/
│   ├── luci-app-example-1.2.0-r1.apk
│   └── luci-app-example_1.2.0-r1_x86_64.ipk
├── aarch64_cortex-a53/
│   └── luci-app-example-1.2.0-r1.apk
├── noarch/                     ← architecture-independent apk
│   └── luci-theme-example-0.11.6-r1.apk
├── all/                        ← architecture-independent ipk
│   └── luci-theme-example_0.11.6-r1_all.ipk
├── manifest.txt                ← written by `owfeed release`, not by a build
├── manifest.txt.sig
└── notes.md
```

## Rules

1. **The root is `dist/`.** Producers may offer a flag; the default is `dist`.

2. **One directory per architecture, named as downloads.openwrt.org spells it** —
   `x86_64`, `aarch64_cortex-a53`, `mips_24kc`. Not an abbreviation, not a target triple,
   not a tool's internal shorthand. `owfeed.lock` records the authoritative set.

3. **The directory is named for the architecture the package itself declares.** For an
   architecture-independent package the two formats disagree on the spelling, so the two
   artifacts land in different directories:

   | Format | Package metadata says | Directory |
   |---|---|---|
   | apk | `noarch` | `dist/noarch/` |
   | ipk | `all` | `dist/all/` |

   This is not an inconsistency to be normalised away. apk rejects `all` as uninstallable —
   which is why OpenWrt's own `package-pack.mk` translates it — and opkg has never heard of
   `noarch`. Writing an `_all.ipk` into `noarch/` would leave the tree disagreeing with the
   package inside it, and an index built from that tree would be wrong in a way nothing
   downstream can detect. The translation is the producer's job, done once, at the point
   where the package's own architecture is known.

4. **Filenames do not carry the architecture** — in a feed, the architecture is the
   directory. An apk's name is derived from the package name and version alone. The `_<arch>`
   suffix is added by `owfeed release` and only where flat release assets would otherwise
   collide; ingest strips it back off. A producer never adds it.

5. **Architecture directories hold nothing but `.apk` and `.ipk` files.** Anything else is
   ignored by readers, which means anything else placed there is invisible and will be
   assumed absent. `manifest.txt`, `manifest.txt.sig`, `notes.md` and an installer script
   belong at the root of `dist/`.

6. **Both formats belong in the same tree when both release lines are served.** 25.12
   installs the `.apk`, 24.10 the `.ipk`. Producing only one abandons half the users, and
   nothing downstream can recover the missing half.

7. **Signing does not move or rename anything.** `owfeed sign` rewrites artifacts in place;
   `owfeed index` fans them out into the published layout. A tree that has been signed is
   still a valid artifact tree.

## Producers and consumers

| Produced by | Consumed by |
|---|---|
| `owlab build` (SDK compilation) | `owfeed sign` — in-package signatures |
| `owfeed build` (mkpkg staging) | `owfeed release` — signed manifest for a GitHub release |
| `openwrt/gh-action-sdk`, hand-written SDK calls | `owfeed index` — the published feed layout |
| a feed's ingest scripts, unpacking an upstream release | a feed's tree checks |

A producer's entire obligation is this document. Nothing in owfeed inspects how the bytes
were made, and nothing should start to.

## Reader obligations

* Walk the immediate subdirectories of the root, skipping dotfiles. Directory name is the
  architecture, verbatim.
* Take `.apk` and `.ipk`; ignore everything else silently — a producer may leave logs or
  staging leftovers, and failing on them would make the contract brittle for no gain.
* Never infer the architecture from a filename. It is the directory, and only the directory.
* An empty tree is an error worth naming. Silence here reads downstream as "nothing to
  publish", which is indistinguishable from a build that failed quietly.
